 Exercise-induced angina is a type of chest pain that comes on with exercise, stress, or other
  things that make the heart work harder.
 It is a symptom of coronary artery disease,
 which is caused by cholesterol-clogged coronary arteries1.
 Angina is generally caused from not getting enough blood through the arteries
 to supply the walls of the heart with enough blood flow to adequately pump2.
